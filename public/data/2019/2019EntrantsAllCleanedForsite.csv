The loss of elasticity of the CPM following radiation treatment causes the lubricant applied to the bougie to accumulate proximal to the muscle and blood caused by disruption of the esophageal mucosal to remain distal to it. To maintain mucosal integrity in the vicinity of the upper esophageal sphincter when passing the bougies the practitioner should administer a water soluble lubricant through a rigid esophagoscope proximal and distal to the CPM at the outset of the procedure.

These burrows provide glimpses into the hunting behavior of the predator. This Cambrian era study looked at data from burrow intersections of trilobites and their vermiform prey to quantitatively determine what amount of trace fossils record an intentional interaction. It was determined that trilobite traces appear to intersect vermiform burrows far more than what would be expected by random chance alone.

The study showed that the decision for participants to “up the ante,” even in the face of long odds, results from an internal cumulative bias involving a “push-pull” dynamic between the brain’s two hemispheres. 

Like the Angel vs. Demon idiom (seen metaphorically on the card design and in the brain), if the right hemisphere has high-frequency activity, it pushes a subject to take more risk (high bet, red poker chips).

Some heart defects, such as aortic stenosis can be detected on fetal ultrasound and for some fetuses, an intervention can be beneficial before birth. When critical aortic stenosis is present in a second trimester fetus, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and weak. As a result, there is less blood flow through the left side of the heart. This can cause the left ventricle to stop growing, leading to hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Through fetal treatment of the critical aortic stenosis, doctors hope to prevent the formation of HLHS.

1) to demonstrate the mechanism of how, unlike the RF ablation, a chemical injection can unintentionally affect a greater length of the intercostal nerve and possibly involve other neural structures, such as the dorsal root ganglion; and
2) to contrast how RF ablation precisely blocks all pain fibers, whereas chemical neurolysis destroys the nerve from the outside-in allowing for the possibility for further pain conduction, (which in the plaintiff’s case developed into a more severe deafferentation-type pain, requiring life-long pain management therapy).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To maximize accessibility, the card game can be printed at home or school and a 3D printable version is available for low-sighted users. In the game, players collect bacteria samples from card hands and grow bacteria in card petri dishes. Game mechanisms illustrate biological concepts, e.g. a DNA change card deck illustrates the randomness of mutations, and that mutations can be helpful, neutral, or detrimental to organisms. Antibiotic cards can kill bacteria, but sometimes multiple rounds are needed. Additionally, if a bacteria in the game is not cleared, it may eventually develop antibiotic resistance. The 3D print version has the same functionality. This game was created as a prototype to suggest how NIH could expand its reach and is also an exploration of accessible design.

Before reaching the heart, the player must avoid the carbon dioxide in the blood, as it will be attracted to them, and if it hits, will cause them to lose an oxygen. This mechanic mirrors the concept of hemoglobin’s use in respiration, since it can both bind to oxygen and carbon dioxide. As a player loses oxygen, carbon dioxide from further away will be attracted to their red blood cell, teaching the concept that as hemoglobin binds more carbon dioxide, other carbon dioxide binds with it more easily. Once reaching the the heart, players must purposefully release oxygen to beat the level. User interface (UI) elements are used to reinforce understanding the basic structure of hemoglobin, by using a stylized Hb as one of the indicators for how many molecules of oxygen the player has left.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
