The loss of elasticity of the CPM following radiation treatment causes the lubricant applied to the bougie to accumulate proximal to the muscle and blood caused by disruption of the esophageal mucosal to remain distal to it. To maintain mucosal integrity in the vicinity of the upper esophageal sphincter when passing the bougies the practitioner should administer a water soluble lubricant through a rigid esophagoscope proximal and distal to the CPM at the outset of the procedure. Application of lubricant to the cervical esophagus as the esophagoscope is being withdrawn can reduce mucosal damage during subsequent bougie dilation.",

    intended_purpose:
      "Often times it is a challenge in basic research to describe the abstract associations in a process because the research findings are novel and are normally not visual. In order to create a single image that concisely summarized the findings, I chose a highly rendered style to see both the vector and the micro-environment of the bite site. This image describes cellular and chemical changes at the bite site during blood feeding by the 'Aedes aegypti' mosquito. Depicted is the mosquito's six-part proboscis including two parallel tubes- the hypopharynx which sends saliva down into the bite site and the labrum which sucks blood and a small amount of saliva up. Mosquito bites induce mast cell degranulation and secretion of 5HT, CysLT and ADP. Mosquito saliva contains pharmacologically active substances that prevent blood vessels from constricting, stop blood from clotting, inhibit platelet aggregation and prevent inflammation.",

However, visual evidence too often captures not the interaction, but the aftermath, particularly in soft-bodied taxa. Without these snapshots, we are left to rely on sedimentary trace fossil records. These burrows provide glimpses into the hunting behavior of the predator. This Cambrian era study looked at data from burrow intersections of trilobites and their vermiform prey to quantitatively determine what amount of trace fossils record an intentional interaction. It was determined that trilobite traces appear to intersect vermiform burrows far more than what would be expected by random chance alone. Once this was established, the next challenge was to determine a preferred angle of attack. It was found that indeed, low angle attacks seemed to be the preferred orientation.",

In this study, the canine model is used to compare augmentation techniques in tenodesis with suspensory fixation: OsteoCrete (a bone void filler) vs interference screw. \r\nIn the procedure, the origin of the long head of the biceps tendon was transected and whipstitched. A 7-mm diameter socket was then drilled into the proximal humerus and the tendon was inserted using a tension-slide technique. In one limb, OsteoCrete was injected into the socket before final tensioning of the suspensory button. In the other limb, a 7-mm interference screw was inserted after the button was tensioned.\r\nIt was concluded that OsteoCrete significantly improved fixation, particularly in low quality bone.",

When critical aortic stenosis is present in a second trimester fetus, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and weak. As a result, there is less blood flow through the left side of the heart. This can cause the left ventricle to stop growing, leading to hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Through fetal treatment of the critical aortic stenosis, doctors hope to prevent the formation of HLHS.\r\n\r\nPediatrics Nationwide magazine is a channel for knowledge exchange among pediatric clinicians and researchers and gives an overview of new pediatric surgical techniques and new research.",

Bypass surgery demonstrates that open microsurgery will continue to evolve. By rearranging and combining preexisting bypass techniques, Michael Lawton, MD has developed a new series of 'fourth generation' bypass methodology for treating these complex vascular pathologies. This illustration depicts these new techniques: type 4A bypasses use in situ (or intraluminal) suturing within the conventional anastomosis, whereas type 4B bypasses maintain the basic construct of reimplantations or reanastomoses but use an unconventional anastomosis. Dexterity and meticulous application of these new, innovative microsurgical techniques will be a tremendous asset to every open vascular neurosurgeon.",

Controversies in Skull Base Surgery seeks to provide answers to that question by weighing the pros and cons of three surgical treatment options: transnasal endoscopy, open surgery, and radiosurgery/gamma knife. By focusing on management strategy of these three surgical options, the textbook clarifies areas of controversy that will help neurosurgeons make correct decisions to positively impact patients' quality of life and recovery.",

Straightening of the spine is done by installing various systems of pedicle screws, connectors and rods on the spine.\r\nCustom 3D models of the spine were sculpted. The posterior skeletal image shows typical scoliosis bend; allowing viewers to quickly identify condition. Background images show different levels of curvature & highlight importance of degree of curvature in treatment. Lack of color helps set the stage for the main surgical image highlighting client's hardware. \r\nMain image showcases one techniques used to straighten a bend & features black towers & cross brackets used to surgically bring spine back into alignment so that pedicle screws, connectors, lock screws & rods can be permanently placed to hold the spine in place.",

Due to the complex twist and rearrangement of the optic fibers, there are more complex types of vision defects other than simple hemianopia, and these mechanisms have been barely visualized in 3D. These 3-dimensional views make learning a seamless process, more in tune with the daily practice of clinical neurology.",

However, one desirable benefit of having an onscreen host is the reduction in visual assets needed to keep a video interesting. The development of a template and animated onscreen host was then introduced as a balance. By utilizing Adobe Character Animator and Photoshop, this video combines complexity and intrigue with a traditional paperless animatable character host with the benefits of faster turnaround and editing times required in a publishing environment.",

The first segment of the video introduces the audience to the overall question: 'what is a convolutional neural network and how does it work?'. Next, in an analogy, which is not included in this cut, we use letters instead of pixels to highlight how computers will search for simple elements (letters) in something complicated (a body of text) for specific details (a word or phrase). We help conceptualize how these layers of simple elements are stacked and scanned for interpretation by a CNN. The third segment explains how our letter analogy connects back to how computers interpret pixels. The final segment is the credits and citation.",

By combining BV with Nivo, the immune system is targeted from multiple angles, potentially improving antitumor immune responses. Challenges included that BV and Nivo act on different immune pathways, which are separated spatially and temporally within the body. We used a generic 'liquid' environment to represent both the lymphatics system and bloodstream, and focused the narrative on T-cells'a key player in both mechanisms of action'in order to tie together the two mechanisms into a cohesive, linear story. Accurate 3D representations of proteins were created using PDB data, and the color palette was inspired by histology staining methods.",

Detailed cellular and molecular modeling, dynamic animated motion and subtle visual effects are used to immerse the viewer in a simplified depiction of a complex biochemical process. A muted color palette is incorporated that conforms to branding standards and avoids a 'textbook-like' diagrammatic appearance, but still allows viewers to readily distinguish between characters.

      "This animation was created for a medical malpractice case involving incorrect placement of screws and spacers into a woman's lumbar spine. The attorney requested visuals to help the lay-audience understand the positions of the hardware, and to help explain why the misplaced hardware was an ongoing source of pain and suffering. The CT scans were exported from a DICOM viewer in a fashion that created surface renderings of the bone, screws, and spacers.  Due to artifacts on the CT, and the low resolution of the CT scan, the surface renderings are not geometrically perfect shapes, but they give a 100% accurate representation of what is visible on the CT and how everything is positioned.  The final video was used by medical experts during trial to talk about how the spacers will migrate over time and how the screws affect the adjacent nerves to the legs.",

Plaintiffs argued that CT showed large volumes of free fluid & air (signs of bowel perforation); therefore, further investigation was warranted to avoid serious complications. This animation was created to combat a defense radiologist's opinion (that free fluid/air amounts were small & unconcerning in a post-laparoscopy patient) by summarizing the free fluid/air in one 3D image.  ID and isolation of free fluid/air from each CT slice were performed, followed by reconstruction into a 3D image.  Tissues were selectively cut away or assigned varying opacities to allow optimum visualization.  Some of the most impressive scan slices float out of the 3D image to further demonstrate the free air/fluid was clearly visible.  Labels and illustrations appear over the slices so decision makers could see what a radiologist should see when viewing the slices.",

      "Abx Lab is a 2-4 player card game about antimicrobial resistance for middle schoolers and up. To maximize accessibility, the card game can be printed at home or school and a 3D printable version is available for low-sighted users. In the game, players collect bacteria samples from card hands and grow bacteria in card petri dishes. Game mechanisms illustrate biological concepts, e.g. a DNA change card deck illustrates the randomness of mutations, and that mutations can be helpful, neutral, or detrimental to organisms. Antibiotic cards can kill bacteria, but sometimes multiple rounds are needed. Additionally, if a bacteria in the game is not cleared, it may eventually develop antibiotic resistance. The 3D print version has the same functionality. This game was created as a prototype to suggest how NIH could expand its reach and is also an exploration of accessible design. A card game was chosen to encourage interactive learning, as well as for its accessibility possibilities.",

Instructional color and painterly textures were used to distinguish anatomy.\r\n\r\nViewing the pelvic bowl caudally through the abdominal cavity, with rectum inferior to bladder, figure 10 depicts left-hand attachments to the bladder divided and fascia covering the prostate dissected. A laparoscopic clip applicator places clips around neurovascular bundles in a nerve-sparing way. A robotic retractor retracts the bladder.\r\n \r\nFigure 12b shows the bladder reflected and retracted inferiorly by a robotic retractor, completed nerve-sparing, dorsal venous complex stapled, and puboprostatic ligaments cut.

In addition, I utilized a bold and playful rendering style to pique interest in lay readers while keeping to the theme of bright, colorful imagery associated with hallucinogenic drugs.",

This fascinating hunting strategy makes them invisible to their prey, which can only see green light and not red. The main scene shows a railroad worm coming from the lower right corner toward a millipede. The railroad worm's red head light illuminates part of the millipede and immediate surroundings. Its green lights are dimmest toward the head, indicating the railroad worm is starting to turn them off to avoid detection. A label indicates the general location of the light-producing photic organs in the body segments. The green spots further away from the head are still turned on and show the vivid appearance of the railroad worm's lights. The lower left inset is rendered in a simplified style to clearly emphasize the directionality and timing in which the railroad worm turns off its green lights.",

      "The GPR40 receptor's AgoPAM binding pocket presents the first instance of a GPCR ligand entering its binding site through the lipid membrane. The AgoPAM and full agonist AP8 binds to this novel pocket, helping activate GPR40. The binding of partial agonist MK-8666 (to a different site) also helps regulate GPR40 activation to a lesser extent. These two ligands allosterically regulate GPR40 activation, with full agonist AP8 being the stronger driver of activation. Surface representations of GPR40 and the membrane and CPK representations of the ligands were used to show the spatial relationships between the binding pocket, ligands, and membrane. The insets show the binding mechanism of AP8. When AP8 binds to the AgoPAM site, a conformational change in ICL2 occurs, facilitating a number of interactions between AP8 and residues that situate AP8 in the binding pocket. A ribbon representation was used to simplify the receptor and place focus on the binding residues and AP8 in these insets.",

This piece, based on an article delving into the ethics behind these claims, was featured on the cover of the December 2018 issue of the American Journal of Bioethics, with the intended audience being bioethicists. The article criticizes the claims that CRISPR is a panacea on the grounds that minorities are often unconsidered during its testing. This piece is an analogy of Plato's Allegory of the Cave. The Allegory outlines a scene in which prisoners trapped in a cave see shadows projected onto the wall in front of them cast by people behind them. The prisoners believe this to be reality, but it is only a projection of what the people want them to see. Similarly, in this piece, the prisoner represents a lay person who sees a gleaming, god-like CRISPR as their 'reality,' when the truth is what the audience sees behind the prisoner'an infantile CRISPR still in a test tube in the hands of a researcher.",

    medium_software: "Unity, Artec Space Spider, Artec Studio, Cinema 4D, Pixologic ZBrush, Adobe Photoshop",
    presentation_format: "Virtual Reality surgical training simulation",
    primaryAudience: "Autopsy assistants, Neuropathology and Pathology residents and fellows",
    intended_purpose:
      "Training in autopsy brain removal is challenging because: 1) the number of hospital autopsies have declined, 2) incorrect cutting planes and depth of cut during opening of the cranium can lead to inadequate exposure of, or damage to the brain, 3) initial hesitation to perform the procedure due to proximity to the face, and 4) current teaching tools are limited to drawings and photographs; no physical practice of the procedure is involved. To address this deficit, a virtual reality (VR) simulation was created to teach proper methodology in performing steps of the autopsy brain removal. The simulation provides an immersive VR interactive experience using realistic virtual patient models, sound effects, and haptic responses within a VR autopsy suite, exposing trainees to an autopsy suite environment. It also features real-time visual feedback and evaluation of user performance to assist in improvement of skills and knowledge during the step of opening the cranium with an oscillating saw.",

    intended_purpose:
      "The game aims to teach the audience about the concept of mutualistic symbiosis, using a specific example found in nature between the acacia tree and the ants that live on it.  Game play focuses on resource management, where the player has to feed their queen, and themselves, in order to dig out a home, defend the tree, and add more ants to the colony. The first level focuses only on digging and feeding the queen so the player can the controls and how to use their nectar supplies at an easier pace. The next level adds bacteria and the game's win state of growing the colony, using the new collectable of protein bodies. By engaging the player and adding stakes to these overlapping tasks, they gain an understanding of the specific benefits these ants provide the tree and vice versa, which can be applied to a greater appreciation of how organisms interact with each other in nature.",

    primaryAudience: "College Students",
    intended_purpose:
      "This game teaches the audience the basic functions of red blood cells and hemoglobin, by playing as a red blood cell traveling through blood vessels and deliver oxygen to the heart within a time limit. Before reaching the heart, the player must avoid the carbon dioxide in the blood, as it will be attracted to them, and if it hits, will cause them to lose an oxygen. This mechanic mirrors the concept of hemoglobin's use in respiration, since it can both bind to oxygen and carbon dioxide. As a player loses oxygen, carbon dioxide from further away will be attracted to their red blood cell, teaching the concept that as hemoglobin binds more carbon dioxide, other carbon dioxide binds with it more easily. Once reaching the the heart, players must purposefully release oxygen to beat the level. User interface (UI) elements are used to reinforce understanding the basic structure of hemoglobin, by using a stylized Hb as one of the indicators for how many molecules of oxygen the player has left.",

      "For our Masters Research Project at the UofT BMC program, we created a web application to engage undergraduate kinesiology students in active learning of lower limb anatomy. Kinundrum, a combination of the words 'kinesiology' and 'conundrum', guides students through lower limb biomechanics case studies at increasing levels of difficulty. Case studies present animated injury scenarios, after which students solve interactive problems accompanied by 3D models, animations, and illustrations of the affected anatomy. Kinundrum combines problem-based learning pedagogy with multimedia design and web technology to create an interactive learning tool. Kinundrum marks the first time a collaborative MRP has been developed at BMC, which meant the project was not only more ambitious in scope, but also developed project management, task-tracking, and teamwork skills.",

      "Students from University of Illinois at Chicago Biomedical Visualization program (UIC-BVIS: ?S. Mientka, R. Ehredt, C. Garr, L. Price, A. Wang, D. Robinson, and U. Patel) teamed up with University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine (UTCVM) to create an interactive application to teach veterinary medical students in their 1st and 2nd year introduction to small animal anesthesia machine. Knowledge of anesthesia machines are understandably crucial to veterinary medical surgery and used during other diagnostic modalities. Students are typically introduced to learning the anesthetic equipment setup via lectures and internet videos. Subsequently they are tested on their knowledge of each component and the proper set up of the anesthesia machine. This application aims to bridge the gap between first introduction and hands-on interaction with the machine to promote accuracy and long-term memory.",

    primaryAudience: "Middle school biology students",
    intended_purpose:
      "The anatomy of the cell and cellular processes are fundamental topics that are often difficult to understand for an audience of middle school biology students. One reason is that students try to create 3D mental images of cellular organelles while trying to understand their spatial relationships and cellular processes. Cell Explorer is an interactive virtual reality game built for the HTC Vive that aims to mitigate cognitive overload and evoke wonder by creating an accurate cellular 'world.' The objective of this game is to create a protein by moving through and interacting with the cell's organelles, encouraging the user to learn spatial relationships. Each organelle is visually stunning and color coded to keep the users' attention and help information retention. The user physically performs actions that the corresponding cellular components would mechanically perform. This kinetic learning reinforces written information nested in the game and concepts taught in the classroom.",

Viral transcription maps are a type of complex diagram that frequently appear in undergraduate virology courses or virology journal articles that students are expected to interpret. These maps visually condense, encode, and depict the spatial and temporal\r\nrelationships between the viral transcription products and the underlying genome.\r\nThis interactive website uses the adenovirus transcription map as an example to teach undergraduate students how the viral genome is related to its gene products. Students can hover over the 2D elements in the transcription map to dynamically visualize the transcript names and their relationships to the protein components in a 3D structure of the assembled virus. Students can also toggle different modes to visually filter the map as well as access additional information.",
