    intended_purpose: "The intended purpose of these two figures was to present the microanatomy and structures affected by vestibular schwannomas, as well as microsurgical approaches for the treatment. To present the impact of the vestibular schwannoma on the cranial nerves, a posterolateral view and a superior view were selected. The combination of both views allows the reader to observe the compression of CN V, VII, IX, and X. The transparency applied to the tumor also demonstrates the compression of nerves and displacement of vessels. In theÂ second part of the series, three operative approaches are demonstrated. Each approach is explained with a posterolateral orientation and incision view, as well as two views to show the area of craniotomy diagrammatically. The larger, more detailed inset shows the affected structures and approach. A minimal rendering and color palette is used throughout to help the viewer focus on the main area of interest: the vestibular schwannoma and the affected structures."

We approached this challenge by outlining the journey of a vaccine injected into the deltoid muscle to the lymph node. In the lymph node, we focused on the immunological synapse between an antigen-presenting cell (APC) and a CD8+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, and B cell. At these synapses, the integration of signals between various receptors, molecules, and peptides leads to the adaptive immune response. Biologic variability can arise at each one of these signal interactions, and the desired immune response to the vaccine can be compromised. The illustration intended to educate sophisticated investors in global health about the complexity of vaccines today and start a conversation about simplifying vaccines to create a more universally effective vaccine for the future."

These selected illustrations from the course depict key steps during the exposure of the axillary artery. Relevant anatomy and anatomical landmarks are reviewed to assist with ideal skin incision location. The incision is placed below the clavicle should it need to be extended into the arm. The pectoralis major muscle is quickly exposed just deep to the skin and separated along directional muscle fibers. This exposes the pectoralis minor muscle which is raised away from delicate underlying neurovasculature using a retractor and divided to quickly and safely expose the axillary artery."

The whole set allows the viewers to compare the genetic flow, the viral glycoproteins that facilitate entry, and the two exit mechanisms: lytic and non-lytic. For example, after cross-examining the genetic flow, the viewers may notice that not all viral genomes enter the nucleus. Among the ones that enter the nucleus, HPV and HIV can integrate their genome into the host genome. In addition, HPV utilizes Golgi and ER to dissemble itself, while most of the other viruses use ER and Golgi for assembly."

Activation of the trigeminal centers releases a number of key signaling molecules within vascular smooth muscle cells and others, which trigger vasodilation of meningeal vessels. Panel B highlights several of these signaling pathways involved in migraine formation, discovered through provocation models using drugs like glyceryl trinitrate and others (white text boxes), and implicates the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels as a possible unifying mechanism.

It can occur in any joint, but is most often found in the hands, hips, knees and feet. Risk factors in include age, female sex, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, genetics, and joint injury. OA is characterized by pathologic changes in cartilage, bone, the synovial membrane, ligaments, muscle, and periarticular fat. These changes cause pain, stiffness, and joint dysfunction eventually leading to a severe reduction in quality of life.The purpose of this illustration is to highlight pathologic changes of OA at the level of individual tissues. The illustration is innovative for its dynamic use of color and texture to distinguish the specific change occurring in each tissue type. The illustration employs a strong hierarchy of arrows, text, and other graphic elements to clarify how degradation of individual tissues contributes to progressive decline of joint health."

This illustration depicts the key aspects of the procedure for medical student education. Using a finger laceration as an example, the hand is placed palm side down and the syringe inserted 1 cm distal to the metacarpophalangeal joint. Anesthetic is injected around the dorsal digital nerve, which provides sensory information to the dorsal aspect of the index finger (and is supplied by the superficial branch of the radial nerve). The cross section shows the anesthetic deposition pattern of the injection. Due to the proximity of blood vessels to the nerve, epinephrine is contraindicated as it leads to increased vascular resistance and can lead to vascular insufficiency and necrosis."

    intended_purpose: "To regenerate cranial bone defects, tissue engineers need to understand the tissue they are trying to recreate. A long held belief is that more vasculature means better bone regeneration, but new research suggests that specific vessel subtypes drive progenitor cell differentiation and regeneration. This illustration peels back the layers of the calvarium to visualize the spatial relationships between vessel subtypes and progenitor cells. Vessel subtypes are classified by differences in endothelial cell expression, with the hi/lo designation for angiogenic potential. Two progenitor cell populations are found in the calvarium and their density varies on location. Progenitor cells preferentially associate with vessel subtype CD31(hi) Emcn(hi) at the transcortical canals, indicating that these vessel subtypes drive cranial bone regeneration. Visualized together, understanding the layers of the calvarium can enable a targeted approach to engineering vascularized bone."

Use of P-EVs exhibits angiogenesis promotion in mouse models of myocardial ischemia, by delivering miRNAs and active factors to the ischemia-related endothelium through GPIbÎ±-vWF binding, fusion and endocytosis.3D-aided painting is applied to efficiently illustrate the nano-particle assembly, using Procreate, Illustrator and C4D. The deliberate use of 'color' and 'overlay' layer modes facilitates smooth blending of 3D constructed P-EV particles into the 2D painted immune microenvironment."

    intended_purpose: "Total mesorectal excision is a technically challenging surgery that removes the rectum with its fascia as an intact unit while preserving nerves and the vital surrounding structures. Proper dissection can be achieved only with clear knowledge of the complex multi-layered pelvic fascia. Posterior mobilization of lower rectum requires: 1) separation of pHGNF from the rectal proper fascia near the level of promontory; 2) dissection of rectosacral fascia/lig; and 3) anococcygeal ligament. Anterior mobilization of the rectum needs identification of denovilliers' fascia with the landmark of seminal vesicles in male patients. Lateral rectal ligaments that contain mid-rectal arteries are then carefully ligated to fully free the rectum. This top-down view is carefully constructed to both reveal the above structures on a single image, and maximally match the laparoscopic view to ensure its visual comprehensibility for surgeons. Color-coding technique is used to help distinguish the structures."

The amygdala takes this sensory information and bypasses the cortex, and begins the evolutionary fight-or-flight response through the sympathetic nervous system; leading to heart racing, shallow breathing, and tense muscles. The secretion of stress hormones, epinephrine and glucocorticoids cause the locus coeruleus (LC) to release norepinephrine, stimulating the amygdala further. The cycle is intensified and continues. The solid, colored arrows show the continuous loop of hormones responsible for repeated stress.

We proposed a dramatic representation of the emotionally-charged subject that shaped much of our world in 2020: COVID-19 and the quest for a vaccine. We modeled SAR-CoV-2 virions using the latest available structural data and rendered them in high detail to emphasize their complexity. With these virions emerging eerily out of the dark to form a zero, we shine a spotlight on the 'one''”a lone syringe symbolizing the hope science provides in the face of a global pandemic. The layout was designed to also work as a short animation we created to introduce the online version of Nature's 10: bit.ly/natures-10."

Cell surface activities propagate as coordinated waves (similar to the rolling surf of the ocean) on the cell cortex and delineate molecular feedback causing turbulence and excitability. As normal cells transform into cancer cells, they display more waves on their surfaces suggesting that cancer signal transduction activity is increased in metastatic cancer cells.This illustration metaphorically depicts the difference between this biochemical wave activity exhibited on normal and cancer epithelial cell surfaces. This symbolism is represented by calmer (basal) waves on the left, and turbulent (refractory or excitable oncogenic) waves on the right. A splashing crab is shown as an additional symbolic nod to cancer."

The Scale live beneath the leaf sheaths and feed by inserting a long proboscis into the phloem cells of the reed stem.  Life stages of Scale illustrated: just hatched 'crawlers', newly settled immatures, a mobile male and the large sessile females. Another element is the thick root system of the reed holding the delta soil and the erosion that occurs after the reed die off due to scale infestation. Two species of parasitic wasps (Astymachus lasallei and Boucekiella depressa) are illustrated. They oviposit into the female scale and as the wasp larvae grow and pupate the husk of the dying scale turns dark. Wasp pupae inside can be seen. Interestingly, two different species of wasp can use a singe individual scale insect as a host."

The purpose of this illustration is to display the complexity of the structure, and to highlight the CTD of RNA PolII. To do so, I found a point of view where the CTD was fully visible, the overall shape of the complex was unobscured, and the internal DNA path was defined (I added DNA to continue off to the top and bottom). I chose to display as ribbons because their visual complexity helps illustrate the overall complexity of the structure. A hot light on the CTD in a dark scene created contrast to lead the eye to the fairly small chain. In the background are individual transcription factors to give an impression that the supercomplex begins as many individual parts."

Mathematical equations describe how the hairs of the sensory hair cells vibrate, how fluid moves within the inner ear, and how the inner ear vibrates. For the weakest sounds you can hear, the hairs move less than the size of an atom. Scientists are using computational and mathematical techniques to discover how this incredible sensitivity to sound is possible, which will help them to restore sensitivity in people with hearing loss.

To accomplish this, I illustrated the key surgical steps required to open the skull and dura and evacuate the large subdural hematoma. In the process, showing the turning down of the skin/muscle flap, the bur holes drilled through the skull and the removal of the skull bone plate provided an 'OUCH Factor' to help jurors empathize with the pain and suffering the plaintiff experienced in this complex brain surgery.  RIGHT FRONTOPARIETAL CRANIOTOMY-  DUROTOMY REPAIR, BONE PLATE REATTACHMENT AND SCALP INCISION CLOSURE The 'OUCH Factor' was further enhanced through accurate illustration of the steps necessary to close the durotomy, reattach the bone plate with absorbable implants and staple close the scalp incision."

Defendant claimed patient was thin, it was difficult to see when he entered the cavity, and the vessels were very close to the abdominal wall. These exhibits countered that argument.The first exhibit demonstrated the proximity of the major vessels to the abdominal wall based on the pre-surgical imaging, and illustrated the anatomical layers of the abdominal wall passed through to enter the cavity. The next exhibit was sequential slides showing the correct technique for inserting the trocar: elevation of the wall, and the visual cues seen in the scope with their relation to the anatomical layers passed through that would let the operator know where they were before and upon breaching the abdominal cavity."

Many existing resources lump ethanol and soap together and incorrectly show micelles formed by ethanol molecules. In this animation, the ethanol molecules are shown to disrupt the lipids and denature the proteins, but do not form micelles. Due to the gaps in the literature, the virus inactivation is shown schematically to avoid misconceptions. 2) The role of aerosols and droplets in viral transmission is often shown inaccurately in the news reports. This animation distinguishes them by showing droplets falling immediately while the aerosols remain floating in the air. It also emphasizes that both particles (aerosols + droplets) can spread SARS-CoV-2 and can be reduced by wearing masks."

To intrigue and educate investors and the general public, the video would be displayed on their website, as well as reformatted to play on the walls of a planetarium at their launch event. The goal was to create an accessible and accurate video of how neurons communicate and how that communication turns into human action; for example, moving a mouse cursor. With that foundation, the story expands to the promising idea of what recording that neural communication could mean. The challenge was balancing the exciting complexity of brain signaling while maintaining the elegant simplicity of the message to show a skeptical viewer that Neuralink's technology is not magic, but rooted in science."

In cancer, the secretion of certain chemokines from tumor cells and tumor-resident immune cells are responsible for recruitment of immunosuppressive Treg to tumor sites. Treg represent a dominant pathway for down regulating the immune response, and thus may limit the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, blocking the migration of Treg has the potential to restore naturally occurring antitumor immunity as well as to work in unison with a variety of both conventional and immune-based therapies."

We accomplished this using WebGL, a JavaScript API for web-based interactive 3D graphics. Users rotate and zoom in to the 3D models to access 'factoids' and see BiTE's MOA from different vantage points. Anatomical models were based on histological data and optimized for WebGL, while the scale of BiTE molecules and target receptors was exaggerated for clear identification.

The right page shows an intermediate view of the valves, to reinforce the information from histological progression. Combining these visualizations with the widest view of the heart is intended to reinforce the biomechanical impact of the disease."

This leads to some foramina being hidden, most especially the superior orbital fissure, and on occasion, foramen rotundum. In addition, many structures pass through each of these foramina, including veins, arteries, and nerves. The primary objective of this piece was to improve the visibility of the foramina and provide an overview of which combinations of anatomical structures pass through each of them. To improve visibility, the interior cranial base was illustrated from a superior view with an anterior tilt. For quick identification of structures passing through each foramen, and to distinguish by structure type, color was used as a pre-attentive feature."

In both views, the temporal bone is semi-transparent to reveal schematic versions of the underlying cavities to which the ET connects. The left inferior view on the right side of the piece reveals the ET's ostium on the lateral wall of the nasopharynx, which is sectioned at the level of the hard palate.

Below are graphs that show the occurrence of the mutant and the wild type to be in an open or closed conformation. The mutant is more likely to have an open RBD, while the wild type is more likely to have a closed RBD.

    intended_purpose: "This poster visualizes a research study done in the Chesapeake Bay that demonstrates how hooked mussels, Ischadium recurvum, augment the water filtering capacity of oyster reefs.  The graphic flow of bright green and pink plankton draws the viewer's eyes and invites them to explore the graphical map on the left explaining problems of runoff and dead zones. The arrows then lead the viewer to the right, where depictions of the mollusks' anatomy show how plankton are removed from the water. Adjacent corresponding illustrations compare the two mollusks' abilities to capture plankton of different sizes/colours. As the viewer moves to the right, the palette transitions from brown/green to light blue as water is filtered and cleaned, and leads the viewer to the 3D bar graphs comparing the filtering capacities of oyster reefs with and without mussels. Smaller insets between the main mollusk illustrations and the bar graphs provide more information about the oyster reefs."

    intended_purpose: "The full animation was created to fulfill a project for the MAET course in London. The goal of the project is to produce an animation that demonstrates an understanding of a scientific topic with detail and accuracy for a specified audience. In order to fit the salon requirements, the animation has been cut down to 3 minutes. While researching the topic of the role of the pancreas in glucose regulation, I did not find many videos that included the effects of glucagon as well as insulin. I set out to create an animation to explain the delicate balance of these hormones and the effect on blood glucose levels. The video progression allows the audience to picture the process on a scale decreasing in size; slowly zooming further to a cellular level. In order to tackle complex subject matter, the explanations of each stage are presented in simple terms. The use of minimal-style visuals and clear descriptions grants easy access for beginning biology and medical students."

Current leukemia treatments are shown to be a challenge because AML cells sequester into hypoxic bone marrow microenvironments where therapeutics become less effective. A novel platform developed by the DaCosta Lab called the Window Chamber method, allows researchers to track AML cells in vivo in mouse models. The ability to observe leukemic cell behavior in real-time within the 'living' bone marrow can provide innovative perspectives into the effect of the treatment and the development of new therapeutics. Therefore, the dissemination of this method is critical to open new avenues for leukemia research, which could aid in advancing previous technological barriers in the field.An educational 3D animation was created to spread awareness of this method while increasing interest for funding bodies. This 3D animation aims to effectively address core concepts while smoothly integrating video footage with 3D animation."

On the other hand, its non-motor symptoms, especially digestive problems, are often overlooked despite their great significance in possibly indicating the early stages of PD. This narrative 3D animation aims to explain the gut-brain connection in PD and promote public awareness of the early signs of PD. First, the viewer is introduced to the background of PD and the anatomy of the gut-brain axis with simple, didactic visuals. Then, the viewer is gradually drawn deeper into the cellular and molecular storytelling with more intricate visuals. The animation concludes the story by suggesting future directions in treating PD by targeting the gut instead of the brain. The use of plain language as well as immersive sound effects establishes an engaging educational video that is easy to understand by the lay audience."
